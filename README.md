# Six-projects-with-perplexity
six-projects-with-perplexity turns fresh Python lessons into fast, creative two-hour projects powered by Perplexity AI. Each challenge uses all the skills learned, building a practical, growing portfolio. Jump in, try the projects, and share your own twistsâ€”Iâ€™m excited to see what you create!

ðŸš€ Why This Repository?

- Practice active learning by directly applying new skills in realistic scenarios.

- Solve unique Python mini-projects that require integrating all lessons from each stage.

- Build a solid, growing portfolio with clear links between theory and practice.

ðŸ§° How It Works

- List Your Skills: For each project, I document the Python topics, tools, or libraries I've just learned.

- AI-Generated Challenge: Perplexity AI suggests a project idea that:

- Can be completed in around 2 hours.

- requires using all listed lessons together.

- Offers a healthy, realistic challengeâ€”even for experienced beginners.

- Build & Reflect: I implement the project and document what worked, what didn't, and what I would do differently next time.

  These projects each have specified quality assessment scales, and you can give numbers to yourself if you serve any of the conditions and subtasks. Also there is one more feature in this scale, is that if you couldnt finish the project in the estimated time (2 hours), the maximum number decrease to half, which is more fun than a simple coding experience.
