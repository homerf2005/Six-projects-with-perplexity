- python fundementals (variables, I/O, data types, strings, operators)
-  Conditions, loops (for, while)
- Anaconda, packages and virtual environments
- Functions, Lambda functions, map and filter, error handling

- Object Oriented Programming (OOP): Class & object, attributes and methods, class methods, staticmethods
- API, URL, requests
- numpy library, some built-in python libraries (Time, Math, datetime)

give me a project to develop that is:
- a bit challenging, i want to learn somthings new
- feasible, easy to complete in 1-2 hours
- solving a real world problem
